# Overview
This Jupyter notebook is part of the coursework for data science and it focuses on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It contains several key functions for text processing and analysis, designed to build and evaluate language models.

## Notebook Contents
1. **Assignment 1**: Introduction and general instructions.
2. **Preprocess Function**: Explanation and usage of the text preprocessing function.
3. **Language Model (lm) Function**: Details on the language model function and example usages.
4. **Evaluation (eval) Function**: Describes the evaluation function for language models.
5. **Perplexity Analysis**: Discusses perplexity scores and their interpretations.
6. **Match Function**: Outlines the functionality and operations of the match function.
7. **Part 5 Execution**: Detailed overview of executing Part 5, including iterative execution and results compilation for unigram, bigram, trigram, and four-gram models.

### Functions Detailed
- **`preprocess`**: Preparing text data for analysis.
- **`lm`**: Building a language model with different n-gram configurations.
- **`eval`**: Evaluating the language model using perplexity scores.
- **`match`**: Matching patterns or sequences within the text data.

### Example Usage
This section provides practical examples of how to utilize the functions within the notebook to perform specific tasks or analyses.

### Perplexity Interpretation
Interpretation guides for perplexity values derived from the language models, helping to understand model performance.

### Good Luck
End notes and well wishes for using the notebook effectively.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up with necessary libraries such as NLTK, numpy, etc.
2. **Running the Notebook**: Execute the cells in sequence to understand the flow and how each part contributes to the overall assignment.
3. **Modifications and Testing**: Feel free to modify the code to test different parameters or methods as per the assignment requirements.

## Conclusion
This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to building and evaluating simple to complex NLP models. By following the instructions and using the outlined functions, users can effectively manage and interpret their text data analysis projects.
